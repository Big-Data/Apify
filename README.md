Apify
====

[Watch Demo](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJHFt6tVRIU "Watch Demo")

Turn any website into an API. 

Apify gathers a website's data and serves the content in a JSON format which you can GET. This enables you use that data to develop other web or mobile apps. 

We implemented this in Node.js, MongoDB and used Chrome's Extension API. Also, JavaScript everywhere!

TODO
----

* Detect **any** element, especially parent `div`s. 
* Give notifications to user if the selected API changes.
